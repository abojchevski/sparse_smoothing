Reference implementation of the certificates proposed in the paper:

["Efficient Robustness Certificates for Discrete Data: Sparsity-Aware Randomized Smoothing for Graphs, Images and More"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.12952)

Aleksandar Bojchevski, Johannes Gasteiger, and Stephan GÃ¼nnemann, ICML 2020.

## Example
The notebook demo.ipynb shows an example of how to use our binary certificate for a pretrained GCN model. You can use `scripts/train_and_cert.py` to train and certify a model from scratch on a cluster using [SEML](https://github.com/TUM-DAML/seml).
